/* The first line contains the number of statements.
 *
 * After that, statements are given, usually 1 per line. Unless you like
 * your code as an unmaintainable mess... Well, anything written using
 * this is already an unmaintainable mess, but trust me, it'll be even
 * worse.
 *
 * Registers are 0-indexed.
 *
 * Program line numbers are also 0-indexed.
 *
 * The two example files factorial.lvm and sample.lvm are example
 * (surprise!) files to try out: on Linux/OSX/SOMEBSD/SOMENIX
 * ./run-prog.sh factorial.sh
 * or
 * ./run-prog.sh sample.sh
 * to try them out. On M$ Windoze, you have to preprocess the files
 * manually then feed them to .\lvm by hand (or copy-paste). You
 * could also write a CMD/Powershell script to automate it.
 *
 * Script files typically have an .lvm extension, although anything will do.
 * The shell script run-prog.sh takes one argument and gives it to the C
 * preprocessor, and pipes the output to the lvm binary. You can also do
 * that manually. But since it uses CPP, you can exploit:
 * - comments
 * - macros
 * - includes
 * and other preprccessor features.
 *
 * You see, being lazy has its benefits :-P
 *
 * If you don't have a C preprocessor, or don't want to invoke it for some
 * reason, you can refer to this file. Instead of using instruction labels
 * (like NOP, PUSH, POP etc.) use their associated numbers (like 0 for NOP,
 * 1 for PUSH, 2 for POP etc.). They are all put out quite clearly in this
 * file.
 *
 * It is generally good practice to label line numbers every 5 lines, as
 * you might get confused (the only form of flow control is JMPing around...)
 *
 *
 * The default number of registers is 10, but can be changed by recompiling
 * with -DREGNO=<whatever>.
 *
 * The default stack size is 100000, but can be changed by recompiling with
 * -DMAX_STACK_SZ=<whatever>.
 *
 * The default program size limit is 100000 statements, but can be changed
 * by recompiling with -DMAX_PROG_LEN=<whatever>.
 *
 * WARING: Unknown instructions are silently ignored.
